<p>Blob is our educational package built for younger students and teachers who mix having fun with the average classroom</p>
<p>We kept Blob as low cost as possible to keep the door open for any school that may want to try out the Blob teacher assistant</p>
<p>Some of the features include interactive game, projector, voice control, and much much more.</p>
<p>Towards the beginning of the beginning stages of production, blob was quite scary and the internals were quite the challenge</p>
<img src="furby.jpg" width "500" class="city" height="500" alt="prototype">
<p>at the end of it all though we produced a project worth noting</p>
<img src="furby1.jpg" width "600" class="city" height="600" alt="blob">
<p>With the newly added fur coat Blob appeals to young children and is seen as a friendly classroom pet more than a robot/AI</p>
<p>When used in classrooms kids who were before struggling with schooling were seen to have a spike in activity within the classroom</p>
<p>listed below are the features and payment options for the Blob!</p>
